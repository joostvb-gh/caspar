caspar version

- The caspar CVS is moved to http://alioth.debian.org/.  Thanks to the Alioth
  admins!
- Experimental install-recursive target added.  If you'd like to play with it,
  you won't need to adjust your Makefile's.  Just type `make install-recursive'
  and decide wether you like this feature.
- BEWARE! Change in user interface!  caspar.mk variables have been renamed:

   new name     old name
   ========     ========

   csp_CP       CP
   csp_CPFLAGS  CPFLAGS
   csp_CPDIR    CDIR
   csp_CPDIRS   CPDIRS
   csp_LOAD     LOAD
   csp_SCP      SCP
   csp_SCPFLAGS SCPFLAGS
   csp_SCPDIR   SDIR
   csp_SUH      SUH
   csp_SUHS     SUHS
   csp_SUHDIRS  SRDIRS

  This is done to make sure no unexpected name clashes occur.

  For now, we offer a backward compatibility hack: your old Makefile's will
  continue to work.  However, you're advised to switch to the new user
  interface a.s.a.p.
