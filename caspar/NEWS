caspar version current

- Beware!  Yet another unstable bleeding edge snapshot release.  Test results
  are welcomed.

- Typo in caspar.mk which lead to "invalid syntax in conditional" error
  is fixed.

- Added csp_sucp(1) manpage.  This script now gets installed.

caspar version 20060216

- Beware! This is an unstable bleeding edge snapshot release.  Test results
  are welcomed.

- caspar.mk now has support for installing files using sudo, wrapped in ssh:
  it runs something like

   ssh foo@bar "sudo sh -c \"cat - > /duh/blah\"" < blah

  .  To facilitate this, new variables have been introduced: csp_PUSH (default:
  a csp_scp make function), csp_SUCP, csp_UHOST, csp_UHOSTS, csp_DIR, csp_XARG;
  csp_scp_UHOST, csp_scp_UHOSTS, csp_scp_DIR; csp_sucp_UHOST, csp_sucp_DIR,
  csp_sucp_USER.

  A script csp_sucp, dealing with the wrapping, is now shipped; it honors a
  CSP_SUCP_USER environment variable.

  Lots of variables are now deprecated:

   for csp_SUHS now use csp_scp_UHOSTS  (or use csp_UHOSTS)
   for csp_SUH now use csp_scp_UHOST    (or use csp_UHOST)
   for csp_SCPDIR now use csp_scp_DIR   (or use csp_DIR)

  The variable csp_CPDIRS will be phased out: no more multiple cp target dirs.
  Don't worry yet: we still supply full backwards compatibity.

- mk/caspar.mk: install and load now are .PHONY targets, as they should be.
  You'll like this if you have files named "install" or "load".  Thanks Guus
  Sliepen.


caspar version 20050424

- New variable csp_EXTRAFILES added.  This enables one to succesfully run e.g.

    make .bashrc-install

  .  Aren't you all happy now?  Thanks Guus Sliepen for the patch.
- In order to have csp_EXTRAFILES behave nice, .%.swp is added to
  csp_TABOOFILES_DEFAULT and .svn is added to csp_TABOODIRS_DEFAULT.


caspar version 20050302

- Fixed caspar(7) manpage: the last part was not typesetted.  Duh.


caspar version 20050301

- BEWARE!  BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITY!  mk/caspar.mk is no longer supply backward
  compatibility with caspar <= 20030825.  If you use old-style Makefiles, you'll
  have to fix these now.  See the 20040531 NEWS item for details.

  A crude way to update your Makefiles would be to run something along the lines
  of:

   % find . -name Makefile | while read f; \
       do sed -i 's/SDIR/csp_SCPDIR/g; s/(SUH)/(csp_SUH)/g; \
                  s/^LOAD /csp_LOAD /; s/(SUHS)/(csp_SUHS)/g; \
                  s/^SUH /csp_SUH /; s/^SUHS /csp_SUHS /' $f; done
   % find . -name install.mk | while read f; \
       do sed -i 's/^SRDIRS /csp_SUHDIRS /g' $f; done

  This kinda worked for me.  YMMV.
- New variables csp_TABOO{DIRS,FILES}_{ADD,SKIP} in caspar.mk.  See caspar(7).


caspar version 20040721

- This release is planned to get shipped with Debian: it will be available
  from the Debian archive.
- No functional changes, just some minor documentation updates and tweaks of
  the build system (interesting only for people building a tarball from CVS).


caspar version 20040531

- The caspar CVS is moved to http://alioth.debian.org/.  Thanks to the Alioth
  admins!
- Experimental install-recursive target added.  If you'd like to play with it,
  you won't need to adjust your Makefile's.  Just type `make install-recursive'
  and decide wether you like this feature.
- BEWARE! Change in user interface!  caspar.mk variables have been renamed:

   new name     old name
   ========     ========

   csp_CP       CP
   csp_CPFLAGS  CPFLAGS
   csp_CPDIR    CDIR
   csp_CPDIRS   CPDIRS
   csp_LOAD     LOAD
   csp_SCP      SCP
   csp_SCPFLAGS SCPFLAGS
   csp_SCPDIR   SDIR
   csp_SUH      SUH
   csp_SUHS     SUHS
   csp_SUHDIRS  SRDIRS

  This is done to make sure no unexpected name clashes occur.

  For now, we offer a backward compatibility hack: your old Makefile's will
  continue to work.  However, you're advised to switch to the new user
  interface a.s.a.p.


caspar version 20030825

- CPFLAGS and SCPFLAGS added to caspar.mk.  See caspar(7), as well as the
  caspar.mk file itself.


caspar version 20030809

- Added manpages caspar(7) and caspar-typesetting(7).  Installed in
  /usr[/local]/share/doc/caspar too, in various formats.


caspar version 20030803
