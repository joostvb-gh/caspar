Refer to ChangeLog for detailed per-file info.

caspar version CURRENT

- New variable csp_EXTRAFILES added.  This enables one to succesfully run

    make .bashrc-install

  .  Aren't you all happy now?  Thanks Guus Sliepen for the patch.
- In order to have csp_EXTRAFILES behave nice, .%.swp is added to
  csp_TABOOFILES_DEFAULT and .svn is added to csp_TABOODIRS_DEFAULT.


caspar version 20050302

- Fixed caspar(7) manpage: the last part was not typesetted.  Duh.


caspar version 20050301

- BEWARE!  BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBILITY!  mk/caspar.mk is no longer supply backward
  compatibility with caspar <= 20030825.  If you use old-style Makefiles, you'll
  have to fix these now.  See the 20040531 NEWS item for details.

  A crude way to update your Makefiles would be to run something along the lines
  of:

   % find . -name Makefile | while read f; \
       do sed -i 's/SDIR/csp_SCPDIR/g; s/(SUH)/(csp_SUH)/g; \
                  s/^LOAD /csp_LOAD /; s/(SUHS)/(csp_SUHS)/g; \
                  s/^SUH /csp_SUH /; s/^SUHS /csp_SUHS /' $f; done
   % find . -name install.mk | while read f; \
       do sed -i 's/^SRDIRS /csp_SUHDIRS /g' $f; done

  This kinda worked for me.  YMMV.
- New variables csp_TABOO{DIRS,FILES}_{ADD,SKIP} in caspar.mk.  See caspar(7).


caspar version 20040721

- This release is planned to get shipped with Debian: it will be available
  from the Debian archive.
- No functional changes, just some minor documentation updates and tweaks of
  the build system (interesting only for people building a tarball from CVS).


caspar version 20040531

- The caspar CVS is moved to http://alioth.debian.org/.  Thanks to the Alioth
  admins!
- Experimental install-recursive target added.  If you'd like to play with it,
  you won't need to adjust your Makefile's.  Just type `make install-recursive'
  and decide wether you like this feature.
- BEWARE! Change in user interface!  caspar.mk variables have been renamed:

   new name     old name
   ========     ========

   csp_CP       CP
   csp_CPFLAGS  CPFLAGS
   csp_CPDIR    CDIR
   csp_CPDIRS   CPDIRS
   csp_LOAD     LOAD
   csp_SCP      SCP
   csp_SCPFLAGS SCPFLAGS
   csp_SCPDIR   SDIR
   csp_SUH      SUH
   csp_SUHS     SUHS
   csp_SUHDIRS  SRDIRS

  This is done to make sure no unexpected name clashes occur.

  For now, we offer a backward compatibility hack: your old Makefile's will
  continue to work.  However, you're advised to switch to the new user
  interface a.s.a.p.


caspar version 20030825

- CPFLAGS and SCPFLAGS added to caspar.mk.  See caspar(7), as well as the
  caspar.mk file itself.


caspar version 20030809

- Added manpages caspar(7) and caspar-typesetting(7).  Installed in
  /usr[/local]/share/doc/caspar too, in various formats.


caspar version 20030803

- See doc/ChangeLog.2002 for news about caspar 20030803 and earlier
