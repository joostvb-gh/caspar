--- typesetting stuff ---

- get toc printed in html mode. even while using nochunks mode.

- license should be printed, see rh vs deb doc.

- add zoem.mk, for zoem ( http://micans.org/zoem ) typesetting.

--- install stuff ---

- finish support for sudo.  Finish manpage for new script: csp_sucp.  Finish
  \sec{variables} in caspar.azm (and other stuff too).  Test all examples as
  given in manpage (the "Using csp_CP and csp_LOAD"-one is fine). Finish NEWS.

- We'll have to drop support for csp_SUHDIRS.

- Document and finish csp_PUSH-plugin architecture.  plugins can use
  csp_<plugin>_someextravar if needed.

- Don't do
   csp_scp_FUNC  = $(csp_SCP) $(csp_CPFLAGS) $(1) $(2):$(3)
  but do
   csp_scp_FUNC  = $(csp_SCP) $(4) $(1) $(2):$(3)
  and use $(csp_CPFLAGS) for csp_XARGS.
  _Do_ test this!

- this whole thing could probably better use rsync, or, alternatively, perhaps
  caspar is redundant: there is cfengine.  Perhaps people would be better of
  with a get-started-quick cfengine document. See caspar(7).

- add support for install(1).

- The function $(subst -install,,$@) in caspar.mk breaks when filename itself
  has the substring -install.  We might have to use sed here, and strip only
  a _trailing_ '-install' from the maketarget.

- load stuff:
  - Add a better hook for the -load target: more generic please.
  - Create a ``load-recursive'' target.
  - supply daemons.mk: csp_SSHDEBIANLOAD csp_URUKREDHATLOAD , etc, to use
    in load targets

- don't do "all: install load" but do "all: build install check load", with
  optional user-supplied rules for csp_BUILD and csp_CHECK targets.

- install-recursive should call mkdir if appropriate

- The scp invocation is inefficient:

   % make -n README.txt-install net.txt-install
   scp "README.txt" pong:/data/www/doc/doc/;
   scp "net.txt" pong:/data/www/doc/doc/;

  Should be:

   scp "README.txt" "net.txt" pong:/data/www/doc/doc/;

  $@ vs $? might be helpful.

- Implement csp_SUHS_SUBSET: only deal with this subset of csp_SUHS.  If SUHS
  in csp_SUHS_SUBSET is no subset of csp_SUHS, skip it.  Requested by Wessel
  Dankers (and the author).  It'll work nice in cases where you have lots of
  subdirectories holding information for lots of groups of hosts when you want
  to install just for a small group (or 1) hosts.
