--- mk stuff ---

this whole thing could probably better use rsync, or, alternatively, all caspar
functionality should be incorporated in cfengine, a tool for configuring and

add support for sudo, rsync, install(1)

a lot of features are still undocumented

convert README to pod or dbx

add big example
