-- docbook stuff --

get toc printed in html mode. even while using nochunks mode.

license should be printed, see rh vs deb doc

--- mk stuff ---

- this whole thing could probably better use rsync, or, alternatively, all
  caspar functionality should be incorporated in cfengine, a tool for
  configuring and maintaining network machines.

- add support for sudo, rsync, install(1)

- a lot of features are still undocumented

- convert README to pod or dbx

- add big example

- The function $(subst -install,,$@) in caspar.mk breaks when filename itself
has the substring -install.  We might have to use sed here, and strip only
a _trailing_ '-install' from the maketarget.

- Add a better hook for the -load target: more generic please.

- The scp invocation is inefficient:

 % make -n README.txt-install beheersnet.txt-install
 scp "README.txt" pong:/data/www/doc/doc/;
 scp "beheersnet.txt" pong:/data/www/doc/doc/;

Should be:

 scp "README.txt" "beheersnet.txt" pong:/data/www/doc/doc/;

$@ vs $? might be helpful.
