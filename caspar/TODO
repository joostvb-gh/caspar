-- docbook stuff --

get toc printed in html mode. even while using nochunks mode.

license should be printed, see rh vs deb doc

--- mk stuff ---

this whole thing could probably better use rsync, or, alternatively, all caspar
functionality should be incorporated in cfengine, a tool for configuring and
maintaining network machines.

add support for sudo, rsync, install(1)

a lot of features are still undocumented

convert README to pod or dbx

add big example

The function $(subst -install,,$@) in caspar.mk breaks when filename itself
has the substring -install.  We might have to use sed here, and strip only
a _trailing_ '-install' from the maketarget.

Add a better hook for the -load target: more generic please.
