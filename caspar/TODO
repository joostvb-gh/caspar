--- typesetting stuff ---

- get toc printed in html mode. even while using nochunks mode.

- license should be printed, see rh vs deb doc.

- add zoem.mk, for zoem ( http://micans.org/zoem ) typesetting.

--- install stuff ---

- this whole thing could probably better use rsync, or, alternatively, all
  caspar functionality should be incorporated in cfengine, a tool for
  configuring and maintaining network machines.

- add support for sudo, rsync, install(1)

- The function $(subst -install,,$@) in caspar.mk breaks when filename itself
  has the substring -install.  We might have to use sed here, and strip only
  a _trailing_ '-install' from the maketarget.

- load stuff:
  - Add a better hook for the -load target: more generic please.
  - Create a ``load-recursive'' target.
  - supply daemons.mk: csp_SSHDEBIANLOAD csp_URUKREDHATLOAD , etc, to use
    in load targets

- install-recursive should call mkdir if appropriate

- The scp invocation is inefficient:

   % make -n README.txt-install net.txt-install
   scp "README.txt" pong:/data/www/doc/doc/;
   scp "net.txt" pong:/data/www/doc/doc/;

  Should be:

   scp "README.txt" "net.txt" pong:/data/www/doc/doc/;

  $@ vs $? might be helpful.

-- other stuff ---

- Add link to http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/02/msg00495.html ,
  mention the non-caspar make-your-/etc-a-working-copy hack.  Could be
  on webpage.
