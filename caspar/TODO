-- docbook stuff --

add support for DocBook in SGML:

 sgmltools --verbose --dsssl-spec=/usr/local/share/sgml/caspar/print.dsl --backend=ps abs-book.sgml > abs-book.ps

gv can't grok the generated PostScript.  duh.  however, we have a .dvi file in /             tmp/ :


--- mk stuff ---

this whole thing could probably better use rsync, or, alternatively, all caspar
functionality should be incorporated in cfengine, a tool for configuring and
maintaining network machines.

add support for sudo, rsync, install(1)

a lot of features are still undocumented

convert README to pod or dbx

add big example
