-- docbook stuff --

get toc printed in html mode. even while using nochunks mode.

license should be printed, see rh vs deb doc

--- mk stuff ---

- this whole thing could probably better use rsync, or, alternatively, all
  caspar functionality should be incorporated in cfengine, a tool for
  configuring and maintaining network machines.

- add support for sudo, rsync, install(1)

- The function $(subst -install,,$@) in caspar.mk breaks when filename itself
  has the substring -install.  We might have to use sed here, and strip only
  a _trailing_ '-install' from the maketarget.

- load stuff:
  - Add a better hook for the -load target: more generic please.
  - Create a ``load-recursive'' target.
  - supply daemons.mk: csp_SSHDEBIANLOAD csp_URUKREDHATLOAD , etc, to use
    in load targets

- The scp invocation is inefficient:

   % make -n README.txt-install net.txt-install
   scp "README.txt" pong:/data/www/doc/doc/;
   scp "net.txt" pong:/data/www/doc/doc/;

  Should be:

   scp "README.txt" "net.txt" pong:/data/www/doc/doc/;

  $@ vs $? might be helpful.

- Check mk/Makefile.am: check if it now does the right thing when using
  DESTDIR in package build scripts.  (In version 20040721, it still created
  symlinks like

   ./usr/include/caspar/mk/caspar.mk -> /usr/local/src/debian/caspar/20040721/caspar-20040721/debian/caspar/usr/share/caspar/mk/caspar.mk

  .

- caspar(7) manpage (html, at least) is broken: last part missing.

-- other stuff ---

- Document registration at directory.fsf.org
- Add link to http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel/2005/02/msg00495.html ,
  mention the non-caspar make-your-/etc-a-working-copy hack.  Could be
  on webpage.
