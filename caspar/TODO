- reimplement bootstrap as something like

   AUTOMAKE=automake-1.9 ACLOCAL=aclocal-1.9 autoreconf --install \
      --symlink --make

--- typesetting stuff ---

- get toc printed in html mode. even while using nochunks mode.

- license should be printed, see rh vs deb doc.

- add zoem.mk, for zoem ( http://micans.org/zoem ) typesetting.

--- install stuff ---

- this whole thing could probably better use rsync, or, alternatively, perhaps
  all caspar functionality could be incorporated in cfengine.  See caspar(7).

- add support for sudo, rsync, install(1)

- The function $(subst -install,,$@) in caspar.mk breaks when filename itself
  has the substring -install.  We might have to use sed here, and strip only
  a _trailing_ '-install' from the maketarget.

- load stuff:
  - Add a better hook for the -load target: more generic please.
  - Create a ``load-recursive'' target.
  - supply daemons.mk: csp_SSHDEBIANLOAD csp_URUKREDHATLOAD , etc, to use
    in load targets

- install-recursive should call mkdir if appropriate

- The scp invocation is inefficient:

   % make -n README.txt-install net.txt-install
   scp "README.txt" pong:/data/www/doc/doc/;
   scp "net.txt" pong:/data/www/doc/doc/;

  Should be:

   scp "README.txt" "net.txt" pong:/data/www/doc/doc/;

  $@ vs $? might be helpful.

- Implement csp_SUHS_SUBSET: only deal with this subset of csp_SUHS.  If SUHS in
  csp_SUHS_SUBSET is no subset of csp_SUHS, skip it.  Requested by Wessel Dankers
  (and the author).  It'll work nice in cases where you have lots of subdirectories
  holding information for lots of groups of hosts when you want to install just for
  a small group (or 1) hosts.
