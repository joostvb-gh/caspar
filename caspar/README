caspar - run 'make install' from within a cvs tree

caspar is named after Caspar the Friendly Ghost, since that's the title
of the Daniel Johnston song I was listening to when deciding to package
my homegrown scripts.

 some thoughts

The default GNU make include path is .:PREFIX/include:/usr/gnu/include:
/usr/local/include:/usr/include .  See make.info, node `Include'.  FHS however
says: '/usr/include [...] is where all of the system's general-use include
files for the C and C++ programming languages should be placed.'  This makes
GNU make somewhat incompatible with the FHS :( .  GNU make could better use
something like '/usr/share/mk' in its default include path.

 include caspar/mk/foo.mk

 /usr/local/include/caspar/mk/foo.mk -> ../../../share/caspar/mk/foo.mk

includedir PREFIX/include
datadir    PREFIX/share
