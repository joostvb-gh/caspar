caspar - run 'make install' from within a cvs tree

caspar is named after Caspar the Friendly Ghost, since that's the title
of the Daniel Johnston song I was listening to when deciding to package
my homegrown scripts.

Within a CVS tree, create a file include/install.mk, with contents like e.g.

 SUH = root@some.host.somewhere
 include caspar/mk/install.mk

.  Within each other directory of the CVS tree which holds files, create a
Makefile, which looks like e.g.

 DIR = /some/dir/ectory
 include ../../include/install.mk

.

The default GNU make include path is .:PREFIX/include:/usr/gnu/include:
/usr/local/include:/usr/include .  See make.info, node `Include'.  FHS however
says: '/usr/include [...] is where all of the system's general-use include
files for the C and C++ programming languages should be placed.'  This makes
GNU make somewhat incompatible with the FHS :( .  GNU make could better use
something like '/usr/share/mk' in its default include path.

We work around this by creating the following symlink when being 'make
install'-ed:

 /usr/local/include/caspar/mk/install.mk ->
                                    /usr/local/share/caspar/mk/install.mk

.

The enables us to be able to call

 include caspar/mk/install.mk

from a Makefile.
