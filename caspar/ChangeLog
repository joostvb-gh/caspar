  * README: finally got to document it.
  * mk/caspar.mk: renamed `DIR' to `SDIR'; renamed XXTARGETS to LOAD: more
     descriptive name.

caspar (20020226)

  * mk/install.mk: we conditionally set SRDIRS using SUH and DIR: now Makefiles
     can use these two vars too.
  * mk/install.mk: Now CPDIRS uses <file>-install as targetname, as SRDIRS
     already did.
  * First tarball build; preliminary release
