\NAME{casparize}{Set up \caspar Makefile in a new directory}

\sec{synopsis}{SYNOPSIS}
\par{
  \casparize
    \synreqopt{dir}{/path/to/config/dir}
}
\par{
  \casparize
    \synreqopt{file}{/path/to/config/dir/file}
}

\sec{description}{DESCRIPTION}

\casparize creates a new configuration working directory in your current
working directory, sets up a Makefile for \sibref{caspar}{caspar(7)} in
this new directory,
and optionally copies an original configuration file from its original
system place to the newly created configuration working directory.

\sec{usage}{USAGE}

You typically use \casparize when you already have created the root
configuration working directory with its include directory and install.mk
Caspar include file. By analysing your current working directory and the
configuration directory path you give on the command line, casparize can
deduce the contents of the Makefile in the newly created configuration
working directory. It creates the new directory, creates the correct
Makefile, and optionally copies the given configuration file in the new
directory, ready for its first version commit.

\sec{examples}{EXAMPLES}

A typical example:

\verbatim{
  $ cd <svn>/etc
  $ casparize /etc/postfix/main.cf}

creates the directory <svn>/etc/postfix, creates <svn>/etc/postfix/Makefile
including the proper content, and copies /etc/postfix/main.cf into
<svn>/etc/postfix/main.cf. You can now directly add and commit the new
directory.

\sec{bugs}{BUGS}
