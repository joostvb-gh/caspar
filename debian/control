Description: Makefile snippets for common tasks
 Caspar offers Makefile snippets for tasks like installing files you maintain
 using a version control system, or typesetting documents in some markup
 language.
 .
 If you need to maintain and distribute lots of files (system configuration
 files for Unix hosts using a version control system, e.g.), caspar is likely
 useful for you.
 .
 If you write documents in a markup language like LaTeX, DocBook
 XML, DocBook SGML or POD, and want to automate the typesetting, you'll
 like caspar.  Of course, you'll need at least jade, jadetex and tetex-bin
 from the suggested packages if you want to do any DocBook typesetting.
 .
 It's not strictly necessary to know how to write Makefiles when using caspar.
